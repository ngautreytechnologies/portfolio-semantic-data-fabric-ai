  "title": "Portfolio AI Knowledge Fabric - Graph-Powered Semantic Layer",
  "summary": "A SaaS-style platform that unobtrusively enriches enterprise knowledge by layering AI over a graph-powered semantic data fabric.",
  "problem": "Organizations struggle with fragmented data spread across multiple silos, making it difficult to gain contextual insights, identify relationships between entities, and surface actionable knowledge. Traditional BI solutions are reactive, disconnected, and require manual curation.",
  "solution": "Built a data-centric, graph-powered semantic layer that sits above existing enterprise systems. It ingests structured and unstructured data, constructs a knowledge graph, applies ML/NLP models for semantic enrichment, and exposes an API layer for SaaS applications to query knowledge contextually, without disrupting underlying systems.",
